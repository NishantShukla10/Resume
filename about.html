    <h1>Aakhir kaun banaaya hai ye website ?</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>Nishant Shukla </b>, I’m 19 years old and I am persuing graduation from University AKTU with a <i>Information Technology</i> branch. While there, I learned a lot of theory in subjects like C, C++, Data structure, and more. I maintained a GPA of 8.3.

        I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge into practice.
        
        While I don’t have any real-life work experience, I’ve had a lot of exposure to the business environment. A lot of my courses involved working with real companies to solve real problems.
        
        Now, I’m looking to leverage everything I’ve learned in uni and get some hands-on work experience.</p>
